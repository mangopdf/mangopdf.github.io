So this time I'm coming for _everyone_ all at once.

# Common misconceptions about hacking

# 1. "I can't do it"

You're all like "how do i get into cyber security!! i'm such a fraud, i don't know anything about hacking compared to everyone else!! one time a guy asked me if i use kali linux, but i didn't know what that was, so now that guy is a linux chad and intellectually outranks me for the forseeable future". Can you maybe _chill_ for like five seconds.

Listen. Honey, darling, baby, sweetie, it's not as bad as you think. You want to learn to hack stuff because it seems fun and interesting and it _is_, but all these linux boys keep flexing linux things at you, and it made you feel like you couldn't do it. That's so sad. I weep for you. 

## But fortunately u are simply wrong

I once asked my hacker friend "if you were going to a hacking class, what would be the most important thing to learn there?" and they _instantly_ said "that I can do it". I have been thinking about this basically constantly ever since I heard it, at great personal cost. But it's _true_. 

The first time I hacked something I was like "wait, that's _it_? You can just _do_ that?". It was like finding out that you can just type someone _else's_ email into a mailing list sign up form. Like, there's no way to stop you. It's just that we hope nobody does that.

I want _you_ to have that same experience, so _you_ realise the world is held together with nothing but blind hubris, ripe for your exploitation.

So how am I going to convince you that you can do it? You already didn't know what Kali Linux was that one time, so it's basically over? You're gonna have to become more of an "ideas guy" instead?

Here's the take.

## How do you learn to hack? You _already have_ 

Think about a time in your life when you did any of the following, maybe when you were a kid, or maybe last weekend in the group chat:

* Tricked someone
* Snuck out
* Stole something
* Cheated at a game/test
* Played a prank on someone



### Story time 

My friend once told me how she had this _insanely_ elaborate system for sneaking out of her house at night. 

Her front door had two _really_ loud locks on it, and she didn't want her parents to hear her sneaking out.

She just casually explained that to sneak out, she takes advantage of her nearby bedroom door being very noisy too, because it has a flap on the bottom that drags along the ground when it moves.

So she gets dressed to sneak out, and when she's all ready, slowly starts to push her bedroom door closed. It's really loud now, so she undoes one of the locks, covering the lock sound with the door sound. Then she shuts the door fully, making a loud thud, and at the exact same time, quickly undoes the second lock.

It sounds exactly like she simply walked _into_ her room to go to sleep. In reality, she's standing outside the front door, waiting for a car to come past and provide noise cover so she can close it, completing the execution of _the perfect crime_.

She just said all this and moved on, not realising the obvious mastermind behaviour. But _you_ realise, person reading this blog post. You're like _what_ the heck that's insane, but also really clever? Like it perfectly lets her sneak out, and nobody's ever gonna catch her like that.

_That's_ hacking, it's just not about computers.

She had a goal: to leave her house without anyone knowing. She had something she knew _really_ well, sometimes better than its owner: her house. And finally, she came up with an unexpected use for it: using one loud door to hide the sound of another.

This is _exactly_ what your brain does when you hack a computer, except instead of house stuff, it's computer stuff.
