# Part 1: Sunday afternoon

Heyyyyyy you know when you're like, flopping about at home, absolutely minding your own business, having a nice drink from your water bottle in a way that does not possess _any_ intent to subvert the Commonwealth of Australia? 

It's a feeling I know all too well, and in which I was vigorously partaking when I got this message in "the group chat"[^groupchat].

![Can you hack this man?](/img/sunburnt-country/groupchat.png)
*A nice message from my friend 🙂. A good thing about messages from your friends is that they do not have any rippling consequences.*

[^groupchat]: It's one of those group chats where the name is constantly changing and you have no idea who "illegally downloaded plant farmer" is.

The man in question is [Tony Abbott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott), one of Australia's many former Prime Ministers. 

![if u google tony abbott u get this](/img/sunburnt-country/tony_abbott_wikipedia.png)
*One of Australia's numerous former Prime Ministers*

For security reasons, we try to change our Prime Minister every six months, and to never use the same Prime Minister on multiple websites.

But like don't get me wrong, I love Australia (let's be honest the [national anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfR9iY5y94s) fricken slaps). I just really wanted to say that multiple websites thing.

Here's where it all goes wrong though.

My friend's message linked to a public Instagram[^instagram] post by Tony Abbott, a picture of a boarding pass and baggage receipt for a flight to Sydney. 

[^instagram]: A lot of people don't know that Instagram is actually short for Instantaneous Grammarphone, because it isn't true.

![Instagram post showing boarding pass](/img/sunburnt-country/instagrampost.PNG)
*The since-deleted Instagram post showing the boarding pass and baggage receipt. This picture and I have been through a lot together.*

My friend[^hoggemoade] (who we will refer to by their group chat name, 𝖍𝖔𝖌𝖌𝖊 𝖒𝖔𝖆𝖉𝖊) is asking[^onbehalf] whether I can "hack this man" not because I am the kind of person who regularly commits 𝒄𝒚𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒔𝒐𝒏 on a whim, but because we'd recently been talking about boarding passes.

[^hoggemoade]: As for my friend's nickname being "𝖍𝖔𝖌𝖌𝖊 𝖒𝖔𝖆𝖉𝖊", I will not be providing context at this time.

[^onbehalf]: On behalf of _another_ friend, my many friends a consequence of my outstanding patriotic efforts towards continuing to avoid subversion of the Commonwealth of Australia.

### Earlier: Boarding passes
Months ago, I'd said something in the chat like:

---
> yeah my dude

> people post pictures of their boarding pass all the time

> but they don't know their boarding pass can be used to get their passport number and stuff

> so they just post it being like 

> "omg going on holidayyyy"

> meanwhile some hacker is rubbing their hands together, all "yumyum identity fraud 👀"

> and having a vigorous browse of #flight, #airport, etc. on instagram trying to find more

> brb i gotta go act in the interests of the commonwealth of australia some more

---

So now, my friend, having seen this Instagram post by Tony Abbott, was sending it to me because, uhhhhh

### Disclaimer

Of course, my friend wasn't _actually_ asking me to hack the former Prime Minister.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

𝑯𝒐𝒘𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

I mean... What would you do, if you had that message in front of you? Would you _not_ click it? Are you gonna let a _link_ that's like 50% advertising tracking ID tell you what to do? Wouldn't you be _curious_? The former Prime Minister had just posted his boarding pass. Was that _bad_? I didn't know. What I did know was: the _least_ I could do for my country would be to have a casual browse[^nocrime].

[^nocrime]: To be clear, I didn't want to go do some fun casual identity fraud, I just wanted to know if he _had_ posted something secret, since uh, someone should probably do something about that if it were true (I insist, as they calmly read me my rights). 

### Step 1: Hubris

A casual browse later, I had the picture of the boarding pass, but didn't really know what to do next.

I'd heard that it's bad to post your boarding pass online, because if you do, a bored 15 year-old with an anime avatar might somehow use it to commit identity fraud. But I don't know anyone like that, so I clumsily Googled "uhhh boarding pass hacking".

Eventually I found [an article](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hackers-use-hidden-data-airline-boarding-passes-hack-flights-0180728/) explaining that yes, pictures of boarding passes can be used for Crimes, and the valuable part is the barcode.

Apparently the barcode on the boarding pass contains the "Booking Reference" (e.g. H8JA2A), which you use to log in to the airline website. That sounds suspiciously like a password to me, but I'm willing to conveniently forget to say that out loud if you are.

### Step 2: Scan the barcode
I've been practicing every morning at sunrise, but still can't scan barcodes with my eyes. I had to settle for a barcode scanner app on my phone, but when I tried to scan the picture in the Instagram post, it didn't work.

![Picture of barcode scanning failing?](/img/sunburnt-country/barcodescan_fail.png)


### Step 2: Scan the barcode, but more

//TODO replace with screenshot of photoshop
![](/img/sunburnt-country/boardingpass.png)
*Maybe I shouldn't have blurred out the barcode first.*

I spent around 15 minutes in an "enhance, ENHANCE" montage, fiddling around with the image, increasing the contrast, and so on. Despite the montage taking up way too much of the 22 minute episode, I couldn't even get the barcode to scan[^step3].

[^step3]:You can't just _have_ step 3. You have to _earn it_.

### Step 2: Notice that the Booking Reference is printed right there on the paper

After staring at this image for fifteen minutes, I noticed the Booking Reference is printed on the baggage receipt. I graduated university.

![Boarding pass with booking reference highlighted](/img/sunburnt-country/bookingrefhighlighted.png)
*askdjhaflajkshdflkh*

### Step 3: Visit the airline's website

Having used my image editing skills to get the Booking Reference, I went to [qantas.com.au](https://qantas.com.au), and clicked "Manage Booking". Qantas is the main airline here in Australia, in case you live in a country with fast internet.

![](/img/sunburnt-country/entering_booking_ref.png)
*Part of collection "Pictures taken moments before disaster" (2020), 1920x1080, pixel on canvas*

### Step 4: Type in the Booking Reference 
I was looking at the same login page I'd used to check in to flights. It asked for a Booking Reference and a last name. I had just effortlessly read the Booking Reference from the boarding pass picture, and, well... I knew the last name[^lastname].

[^lastname]: The last name is printed on the baggage receipt, too. So even if I didn't know who posted the picture, everything you need to manage the booking is right there on the baggage receipt in a neat little package.

I hesitated for a split-second, but... no, I had to know.

I hit Enter, and saw this.

![Logged in "Manage Booking" page](loggedin)

## Crimes(?)

It worked. 

![Passenger name, FF number, Flight destination and times screenshot](/img/sunburnt-country/sdff.png)
*"Welcome, Mr. Abbott". How long I'd waited to hear those words.*

### Denial
_"Surely this can't be happening. SURELY anyone who saw that Instagram post couldn't be looking at this page with me right now."_

### Anger
_"Why the HECK are there so many versions of Minecraft for Windows 10, why the hEcK are there MineCoins™ this isn't the future Hatsune Miku wanted."_

### Bargaining
_"Maybe this page doesn't have anything interesting in it."_

Everything on the page looked public. Can't do much with the passenger name and flight schedule.

There was a Frequent Flyer number? The page informed me that this flight had been booked by a travel agent, so some information would be missing. But that's not _that_ bad. Right?

### Depression

I clicked around and scrolled a considerable length to the end of the page, but still didn't find anything secret-looking. 

At the very end, in what was a somewhat surreal experience, I was farewelled by an ad telling me (Tony Abbott?) to rent a car in Melbourne. 

![Car Ad](/img/sunburnt-country/sdff.png)
*No, Qantas, I shall not go gently into that good night. You don't understand.*

### Acceptance

For a moment, I felt relieved. 

Maybe this wasn't such a big deal after all. 

𝑵𝒂𝒓𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒐𝒓: "But it was."

## Absolutely not hacking

Having recovered from the emotional rollercoaster of the five stages someone told me were grief once and I just kinda blindly believed them, I looked at the page again, but like, harder.

I didn't see anything particularly juicy, but we're not done just because a _web page_ said we're done. 

Sometimes there are juicy things hidden in the page's source code (HTML), which you wouldn't be able to see just by looking at the page. To see them, you have to... well....

This is the only step in this story that might be considered "hacking". It's not, though. Maybe later someone will show you this same thing, and tell you it's hacking. You will not go gently into that good night. You will refuse to acknowledge their showing off, killing them instantly.

Suddenly wearing sunglasses, I depressed the right-hand button of my mouse, bringing a textual menu under the mouse cursor into existence. Power and glory. Using my superior intellect, I dragged the mouse pointer to the bottom of the menu, summoned all my courage, and allowed it to pour through my finger as I left-clicked on the "Inspect Element" menu item in such a way that it was clear I possessed godlike hacking abilities.

![Right click > Inspect](/img/sunburnt-country/inspectelement.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/8uZgKCe.png)
*dw, i clicked block*

I cannot stress enough the degree to which this is not an elite hacker tool. 

"Inspect Element", as it's called, is a feature of Google Chrome that lets you see the computer's representation (HTML) of the page you're looking at. Everything you see when you use it was already on your computer, you just hadn't asked Chrome to show it to you yet.

Scrublord techniques such as these are used by programmers to try and understand how the website works. This is ultimately futile: You cannot understand how a website works. Unfortunately, it sure _looks_ like hacking the first time you see it.

If you'd like to know more about it [I've prepared a short video](https://twitter.com/mangopdf/status/1123400764926226432).

## Browsing the "Manage Booking" page's HTML

![Screenshot of inspect element tab open]()

I scrolled around through the HTML and eventually got to a big pile of JSON data 🤔🤔🤔. I skimmed through it, not really knowing what it meant, furiously trying to find anything that looked out of place or secret.

I eventually realised that manually reading JSON with my eyes was not an efficient way of defending my country, and Ctrl + F'd the HTML for "passport".

![Blurred screenshot of me ctrl + F-ing these terms instead of json]()

## Oh _no_

Oh yes.

It's just _there_.

It was next to `documentNumber`, which was a number that sure _looked_ like a passport number. I googled "tony abbott" and checked the birthday on his Wikipedia page. It matched the birthday on the passport.

At this point I was pretty sure I was looking at the _extremely_ secret government-issued ID of the _28th Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, servant to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II_ and I was _kinda_ worried that I was somehow doing something wrong, but like, not enough to stop.

## Why is it bad for someone else to have your passport number?

//todo lol

## What else is in here?

If there's a passport number in this webpage, maybe there's even more? A phone number maybe? Searching for `phone` and `number` didn't get anywhere, so I tried searching for `614`, the first 3 digits of an Australian phone number. _That_ led me to a whole lot of _this_:

```
RQST QF HK1 HNDSYD/03EN|FQTV QF HK1|CTCM QF HK1 61[redacted passenger phone number]|CKIN QF HN1 DO NOT SEAT ROW [row number] PLS SEAT LAST ROW OF [row letter] WINDOW
```

It keeps going, too. It's labelled `PNRRemarks`. 

In what is surely the subtweeting of the century, it also has a section saying "HITOMI CALLED RQSTING FASTTRACK FOR MR. ABBOTT". 

![Blurred picture of PNRRemarks section showing "hitomi called"]()

Who _is_ Hitomi? The flight was from Tokyo to Sydney, so presumably she works at Qantas in Tokyo. She must be requesting a "fast-track" (I thought that was only a thing in movies???) from another Qantas employee. 

Hey for real though? For reeeal though? What is even going on here? Why do Qantas flight staff talk to eachother via this passenger information field? Why do they send the messages about you _to_ you when you manage your booking?

### Forbidden airline code

I realised the allcaps spaghetti must be some airline code for something, and eventually found several ancient forbidden PDFs that explained some of the codes. 

Apparently, they're called "SSR codes" (Special Service Request). There are codes for things like "Vegetarian lacto-ovo meal" (`VLML`), "Vegetarian oriental meal" (`VOML`), and even "Vegetarian vegan meal" (`VGML`). Because I was curious about these codes, here's some for you to be curious about too:

```
RFTV    Reason for Travel
UMNR    Unaccompanied minor
PDCO    Carbon Offset (chargeable)
WEAP    Weapon
DEPA    Deportee—accompanied by an escort
ESAN    Passenger with Emotional Support Animal in Cabin
```

The phone number I saw said `CTCM QF HK1 [phone number]`. Googling "SSR CTCM" led me to the [developer guide](https://guides.developer.iata.org/docs/ctcm) for some kind of airline association, which I assume I am basically a member of now.

![CTCM](/img/sunburnt-country/ctcm.png)

Moving right along from the weirdly-off spelling of "passenger's", this was enough for me to translate `CTCM QF HK1` as "Contact phone number of passenger 1". 

#### Is the phone number actually his?
I thought maybe the phone number belonged to the travel agency that booked the flight, but I [checked](https://portal.iata.org/faq/articles/en_US/FAQ/Is-it-mandatory-for-travel-agents-to-provide-the-passenger-s-mobile-phone-and-email-address-1448977338174) and it has to be the passenger's real phone number. That would be, if my calculations are correct,,,, Tony Abbott's phone number.

## what have i done

I'd now found Tony Abbott's:
* Passport details
* Phone number
* Weird Qantas staff comments.

My friend who messaged me had _no idea_.

## what have i _done_

I walked down the hallway and told my housemate (also a member of The Group Chat) "I think I have.... Tony Abbott's passport number???". 

At this point I'd had enough defending my country and was thinking:

* _oh jeez oh boy oh jeez_
* _i gotta get someone, somehow, to reset tony abbott's passport number_
* _can you even reset passport numbers_
* _is it possible that i've done a crime_

# Part 2: The next four months

I contacted a _lot_ of people about this. If my calculations are correct[^calculations], I contacted at least `PLACEHOLDER_NUMBER` people. Eventually I started keeping track of who I talked to in a Google Keep note I now refer to as "the hashtag struggle". Here it is in spreadsheet form:

[^calculations]: I've always wanted to say that.

![the hashtag struggle](/img/sunburnt-country/thehashtagstruggle.png)
*This is how much I went through to publish this blog post*

There is a _lot_ going on in this section (a loT), so here is a lil cheat code from present-day me: A checklist of what the heck I was trying to accomplish here.

- ⬜ figure out whether i have done a crime
- ⬜ notify someone (tony abbott?) that this happened
- ⬜ get permission to publish this here blog post 
- ⬜ tell qantas about the security issue so they can fix it


Alright strap yourself in I guess.

## is it possible that i've done a crime
I didn't _think_ anything I did sounded like a crime, but I knew that sometimes when the other person is rich or famous, things can suddenly _become_ crimes.

So I was wondering like... was logging in with someone else's booking reference a crime? Was _having_ someone else's passport number a crime? What if they were, say, the former Prime Minister? Would I get in trouble for publishing a blog post about it? I mean you're reading the blog post right now so obviousl

Update: I have been arrested.

---
![screenshot of me googling "did i do a big crime"]()

It turned out I could just google these things, and before I knew it I was reading "the legislation". It's the rules of the law, just written down. I have no trouble reading JSON but whoever wrote the legislation was straight up making up words. I was able to divine the following wisdoms from the Times New Roman tea leaves:

* It's not defamation to publish something negative about someone if it's true
* If u EVER even LOOK at a computer the wrong way, the FBI will instantly slam jam you into the shadow realm

I am possibly the furthest thing you can be from a lawyer, but if you are the kind of person who takes legal advice from blog posts, who am I to stand in your way? Not a lawyer, that's who. Don't do it.

You know what, maybe I needed help. From an adult. Maybe this was too hard for me to do on my own. "Yeah, maybe I should get some of that free government legal advice", I thought. That seemed like a pretty common thing, so I thought it should be easy to do. I took a big sip of water and googled "free legal advice".

### trying to ask a lawyer if i gone and done a crime

Listen I'm going to save you a lot of time that I personally will never get back and skip a lot of this part.

Before I went and told everyone about my HTML frolicking, I spent 9 days calling legal aid numbers, lawyers, and otherwise trying to figure out if I'd done a crime[^noplan]. 

[^noplan]: I'm not really sure what my plan was. If I had done a crime, what was I gonna do, not report the passport number being publicly available?

I'd already told my housemate everything, but aside from that, I didn't tell a soul. I asked if I would be breaking any laws if "someone" had "logged into a website with someone's publicly-posted password and found the personal information of a former politician". Do you see how that's not even a lie? I'm starting to see how lawyers do it.[^clever]

[^clever]: This sounds like maybe I'm doing something remotely clever by not confessing my potential(?) crimes, but I also did this simultaneously while emailing explicit details of my activities to the Australian Government.

First I call the state government's Legal Aid number. They tell me they don't do that here, and I should call another Legal Aid place named something slightly different. The second place tells me they don't do that, and I should call the First Place and "hopefully you get someone more senior". I call the First Place again, and they say "oh you've been given the run around!". You see where this is going.

I eventually realise every legal person I talk to has no idea about "cybercrime" or even what would happen if a computer. I try to find "cybercrime" laywers, and call the one with the website with the least fear-bait marketing. A lady instantly and bluntly asks me "are you under investigation?". No, I wasn't. Well I mean, not to my knowledge? I just wanted to know whether something was a crime or not. She said "well we're criminal defence lawyers, so...". I apologised for bothering her, but then she was all like "well what exactly are you asking?" and I explained and she seemed to think it was fine in a non-legally-binding way.

Let's skip a lot of phone calls here. Take my hand as I whisk you towards the slightly-more-recent past. Based on advice I got from two independent lawyers that was definitely not legal advice: I'm good, I haven't done a crime. Helllllll yeah. I mean it's a little late because at this point I had already reported my actions to the Government.

- ☑️ figure out whether i have done a crime
- ⬜ notify someone (tony abbott?) that this happened
- ⬜ get permission to publish this here blog post 
- ⬜ tell qantas about the security issue so they can fix it

### trying to report the problem to someone, anyone, please

I had Tony Abbott's passport number, phone number, and weird Qantas messages about him. I was the only one who _knew_ I had these. Anyone who saw that Instagram post could also have them. I felt like I had to tell someone about this, but who?

### wait but alex do u see the irony in this, u have his phone number right there so u could just-

Yes, I see it. Thank u for pointing this out, wise, astute and ultimately self-imposed heading. I _knew_ I could just call the number any time and hear a "G'day" I'd never be able to forget. I knew I had a rare opportunity to call someone and have them ask "how did you get this number!?". 

But you can't just _do_ that.

You can't just call someone's phone number that you got by rummaging around in the HTML ball pit. Tony Abbott didn't _want_ me to have his phone number, because he didn't give it to me. So I felt like I couldn't just violate his privacy like that, even if it's for a good cause. Maybe if it was urgent, or I had no other option, sure. But I'm pretty sure I should do this the Nice way, and show that I come in peace. 

I want to show that I come in peace because there's also this pretty yikes thing that happens where you email someone being all like "henlo ur website let me log in with username `admin` and password `admin`, maybe u wanna change that??? could just be me but let me kno what u think xoxo alex" and then they reply being like "oh so you're a HACKER and a CRIMINAL and you've HACKED ME AND MY FAMILY TOO and this is a RANSOM and ur from the DARK WEB i know what that is i've seen several episodes of mr robot WELL watch out kiddO bc me and my lawyers are bulk-installing tens of thousands of copies of [McAfee® Gamer Security](https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/gaming.html) as we speak, so i'd like 2 see u try"

### How about contacting Tony Abbott directly?
I googled "tony abbott contact", but there's only his [official website](https://tonyabbott.com.au). There's no phone number on it, only a "contact me" form.

![Contact me form]()

Yeah right, have you _seen_ the incredible volume of #content people want to say at politicians? No way anyone's reading that form. I didn't even try it.

Who handles Tony Abbott's security? Surely someone does, he's the former PM. Did Tony Abbott even have personal security staff? I eventually realised the place I want to be reporting this lil fun fact was probably the government.

## The government

It's a big place.

There are like fifty thousand million different departments, and they all know which acronyms to refer to eachother by, but you don't. If you EVER call it DMP&C instead of DPM&C you are gonna be sucked into a nightmare realm the likes of which cannot be expressed in _any_ number of spreadsheet cells, and believe me, they've tried.

I didn't even know where to begin with this. I called Tony Abbott's former political party, who were like "uhhhh we dunno what to do with this, nor do we know who to ask, did u try the contact form on his website or". Skip skip skip a few more calls like this.

Who do I tell about a security problem not with a website, but the former Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia serving the monarchy of Queen Elizabeth II?

### The friends we made along the way

Well, maybe I knew someone who knew someone. I asked hacker friends who seemed like they might know government security people.

Look I don't really have a good explanation for this so I'm just gonna post the screenshot.
![Screenshot of 1300 CYBER1]()
*The planet may be dying, but we live in a truly unparalleled age of content.*

You _know_ I smashed that call button on `1300 CYBER1`. Did they just make it `1300 CYBER` then realise you need one more digit for a phone number? Incredible.

### Calling 1300 `c y b e r       o n e`

"Yes yes hello, ring ring, is this 1300 cyber one"? They _have_ to say yes if you ask that. They're legally obligated.

I told the person who picked up that I wanted to report a security issue "where the personal identification information of a former member of parliament was publicly exposed", and they gave me an email address for [ASD](https://www.asd.gov.au/) (the Australian equivalent of the NSA).

I emailed them this:

![Screenshot of my email to ASD]()

Sorry for the clickbait subject line but, well, that's what happened.

Unlike everyone else I talked to, they replied _instantly_ asking whether I was willing to share more details regarding the "potential" exposure of Tony Abbott's passport number. Yeah okay. The reply subject line had "SEC=Sensitive" in it so I _knew_ I'd made it big. 

I sent them all the details and asked some questions, but they didn't reply for a few days. Eventually, after a big day of getting left on read by the government, I got a response.

ASD were really nice to me about it and happy that I'd helped. I gave them the IP addresses I used when I was finding the boarding pass so they could figure out who was me in their logs. I dunno if they even used them, but oh well, helping? They encouraged me to report this kind of thing to them if it happened again, but I'm not really in the business of uhhhhhhhh whatever this is.

At this point in the story I had not yet spoken to a lawyer, and so did not know whether the actions I was confessing to were illegal. This is widely regarded as a bad move, and I do not recommend anyone else rely on "but I'm being so helpful and earnest!!!" as a legal defence.

At one point, the person I was emailing added a P.S. telling me their favourite colour[^nope]. This is the answer to my top secret mango.pdf challenge at the end of [mango.pdf.zone](https://mangopdf.zone), which is fine, but:

[^nope]: This isn't actually true, it was their favourite something else. But it's the answer to my top secret mango.pdf puzzle, so of course I can't go giving it away here. Scroll to the bottom of [mango.pdf.zone](https://mango.pdf.zone) if you wanna try it! (You'll need a computer, not a phone.)

1. The instructions say to tweet the answer at me, not email me
2. The prize for doing the challenge is me sending you this gif of a shakas

![shakas.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/13JoHhCFtUMAZa/giphy.gif)
*yeahhhhhhhhhh, nice*

So I guess I emailed the shakas gif to the government??? Yeah, I guess I did.

![shakas attached dw](/img/sunburnt-country/shakas_attached.png)
*Please find attached*

The nice people at ASD didn't give me many details about what they were doing in response, though. They basically said "thanks kiddO we'll take it from here".

I asked them if they could give me permission to write this blog post, or who to ask, and they gave me two government email addresses. Listen I don't wanna be an "ummm they didn't reply to my emAiLs" kinda person buT they left me no choice.

- ☑️ notify someone (tony abbott?) that this happened

- ⬜ tell qantas about the security issue so they can fix it


## Calling Parliament House


## Finding Tony Abbott's staff

They have to be somewhere. 

I was kinda lost for a few weeks, waiting hopelessly for various government departments to reply to my emails. "It's in their hands", I thought. But actually, no, it's in my hands.

In a moment of determination/desperation/destiny, I went and asked everyone I could think of that _might_ know how to contact Tony Abbott's staff. 

I slid clumsily into the DMs of a woman I found on Twitter who seemed to have sufficient #AusGov #Cyber in her bio, asking if she knew who to contact. She asked how my local police station would feel if I told them what I told her. Ah, no, big misunderstanding. I wasn't asking for help committing a crime or anything[^twitterdms].

[^twitterdms]: But, I do understand how it be sometimes. If you have anything remotely related to "hacking" in your Twitter bio, random people DM you asking you to hack their girlfriend's Instagram account. It sucks, and how was this person to know I wasn't one of those people?

I also messaged a journalist friend asking for help. They had ruthlessly efficient ideas that I presume came from being a professional journalist. They suggested I find Tony Abbott's former staff from when he was PM, and contact their offices and see if they have his contact details.



### Wikipedia stalking

Many of them were retired.

Oh he _definitely_ has an office.

// What people want to know:
"how secret is my boarding pass?" "who can i share it with?

the problem: is a booking reference a username or a password?

// include diagram showing boarding pass, with booking reference labelled.


// sarah's interview
saw the ig post, and thought of me
because of the thing with her sending tom pics of her credit card

she analysed the photo and saw the barcode and that the flight was in the past

and so, as a joke, sent to tom, who sent to me

"this is some real journalism"

Your boarding pass for a flight can sometimes be used to get your passport number. Don't post your boarding pass online, keep it as secret as your passport.

The Booking Reference on the boarding pass can be used to log in to the airline's "Manage Booking" page, which contains the passport number. I saw that former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott had posted a photo of his boarding pass on Instagram, and was able to obtain his passport details, phone number, and internal messages between Qantas flight staff about his flight booking.
